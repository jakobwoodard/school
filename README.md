# school
These are projects that have been completed specifically from school work. Due to Academic Integrity Guidelines, I have included this README page that explain the code that was provided for me in part, and, in some instances, in full. Having transferred the code from one repository to another, they are stored in zip files with package names. To access the code itself, navigate through the folders within the zip files until reaching a file saved as a JAVA file.

For P1: 
  
  -ProjectReader/Writer are modified code
  
  -Given a shell for ProjectManager
  
  -Given ProjectManagerGUI in its entirety
  
For P2:

  -HLOJ file was provided in full

  -HLOJDataReader/Writers were modified code

  -All of the files in the "view" folder were provided in their entirety
