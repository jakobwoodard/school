# School
These are projects that have been completed specifically from school work. Due to Academic Integrity Guidelines, I have included this README page that explain the code that was provided for me in part, and, in some instances, in full. NONE of the code contained under the "school" repo is to be used in any way by another student to have an unfair advantage in future classes in which the contained code may be helpful. Having transferred the code from one repository to another, they are stored in zip files with package names. To access the code itself, navigate through the folders within the zip files until reaching a file saved as a JAVA file.

I hope that the code provided in this repository is a good starting point to see what I am capable of both in terms of my coding style and in terms of how I am able to integrate
on provided code to help fit a new need.
